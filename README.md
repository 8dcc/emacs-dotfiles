**My configuration files for vanilla and doom emacs**

## Doom emacs
The `doom` folder contains my doom emacs configuration files. These might be a
bit outdated since I am not using doom anymore.

Doom looks good, but it's incredibly bloated, unstable and changes too much
depending on the creator's taste (which is fair, but not for me).

For more information, see the README inside `doom/`.

## Vanilla emacs
The `emacs` folder contains all my configuration files for vanilla emacs. It's
similar to doom, but with way less packages. It should work out of the box
without any dependencies by placing the contents of the folder inside
`~/.emacs.d/`.

All the important fonts used are already in my [linux dotfiles repo](https://github.com/8dcc/linux-dotfiles/tree/main/fonts),
but you might also need to install `media-fonts/fira-sans` and
`media-fonts/fira-code`.
